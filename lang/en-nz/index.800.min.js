Monthly running costs for fluff4.me are as low as we can keep them, but even still we're nowhere near a livable wage for even one developer.\n2. In order to cover Chiri's upcoming visa application we need to hit at minimum about $9,000 US in total support by the end of the year â€” ideally closer to $10,000 because there's likely going to be additional costs.\n3. We're still in quite a bit of tax debt accumulated over the past few years where we weren't making enough money yet, so we still need help with that.\n\nBeing extremely frugal with money isn't really helping when the cost of living keeps going up and our income everywhere keeps going down, though I assume that's probably the case for everyone. fluff4.me updates have been slow because we've had to work on other things in a desperate attempt to get money elsewhere.\n\nIf we can hit $1,000 US/mo from fluff, our situation would become a lot less stressful *and* we'd be able to dedicate significantly more time to it.\n\nIf you can help, please do! If you can't, we understand. If you still want to help we'd really appreciate spreading the word about fluff4.me! The more the site grows the more we'll be able to do!\n\nThank you so much for reading. <3"}]),"masthead/skip-navigation":e=>i([{content:"Skip

If you want an audience, you're pretty much required to use a platform. \n\nAnd in the case of writing... historically, the platforms you can use have had a *lot* of issues. Either it's impossible to find things other than the stuff written by the top 10 authors on the site, or it's impossible to filter out content you don't want to see, or the site is ridden with ads, or it's not very accessible, or simply a bit ugly... I'm sure anyone that spends a lot of time on writing websites, authors or readers, could name a hundred more problems they've had.\n\n##### fluff4.me's goal...\n**...is to provide one, singular platform for both authors and readers, that improves things in every way it can.**\n\nIt's a lofty goal, and the team is microscopic, so the chances we'll accomplish it right out of the gate â€” or even any time soon â€” is slim. But we can continue to iterate, and continue to improve, until this place is the best it can be for everyone.\n\n---\n# People Matter.\nThis is the main guiding principle that will determine the direction that fluff4.me will go, in all aspects â€” development, the community, and otherwise. All of our other values are based around this core value. This site isn't for the most popular authors, it's for *all* authors. This site isn't for the bulk of readers, it's for *all* readers. And lastly, this site isn't for AI-generated slop, it's for the stuff that real people have spent their time on.\n\n<WEAVE TAG=\".MINIBLOCK\">\n#### "},{content:[],tag:"ICON.CHART-SIMPLE"},{content:' Stats aren\'t always a good thing\nIf stats are the primary driver of traffic to stories, we\'ve done something wrong. Often, stats lead to users looking for new things to read on "top" pages, which results in the same few stories and authors that are already there get even *more* attention, thereby making them far outpace everyone else, and never allowing anyone to ever catch up again.\n\nWe would argue that this is worse for everyone *including* the authors at the top of the list â€” if a platform is only good for those at the top, the audience will eventually stagnate because they can\'t find everything they want to read there, and stagnation will mean that even the authors at the top will begin to lose traction.\n</WEAVE>\n\n<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">\n#### '},{content:[],tag:"ICON.THUMBS-DOWN"},{content:" The actions users can take affect the vibes\nWe're careful about what kind of actions we allow. For notable examples, we will:\n- **Never allow downvoting content.** Being able to share your appreciation with authors is a good thing, because it's encouraging. Being able to upvote comments is also a good thing, because it means sometimes the quieter people can also feel like they're engaging in the discussion, simply by finding something they agree with. Downvoting, though? The only purpose this serves is to quietly, anonymously tell someone off for what they posted.\n- **Never add systems specifically for rating or reviewing content.** This isn't a marketplace. Not all authors want that kind of feedback. Oftentimes, people will go into a story completely outside the target audience, not get it â€” maybe not even try â€” and then leave a terrible rating or review, making it harder for the work to find its actual audience.

For example, a unique profile could be `fluff4.me/author/CoolUser`, and one of their works could be `fluff4.me/work/CoolUser/AmazingWork`\n</WEAVE>\n\n<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">\n#### '},{content:[],tag:"ICON.FONT"},{content:" Simplified chapter formatting\nThe fluff4.me text editor supports copy-paste from various writing software.

Rather than needing to post your chapter text on Patreon, where the reading experience is awful, you can now post it to fluff4.me instead.

Your patrons will be able to view your content when they login and link their patron account.\n\nAs a side bonus, this means that you can pull in new patrons by keeping the last X chapters in a work patron-only.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.\n\n## A. Accessing the Services\nBy accessing or using our Services, you confirm that you\'re at least 16 years old and over the minimum age required by the laws of your country of residence. You also confirm that you can form a binding contract with fluff, or, if you are over 16, but under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms.\n\nYou may not use the Services if you have previously been permanently suspended or removed from the Services.\n\nIf you are using the Services on behalf of a company or organisation, you represent that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity, and that such entity accepts this Agreement.\n\nWe reserve the right to add or remove features, or grant or restrict access to features, at any time and for any reason. You acknowledge that that some content or features on the Services will only be made available to those 18 or older.\n\n## B. Usage of the Services\n### 1. Your Information\nOur [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) explains how and why we collect, use, (and in very rare cases, could share) information about you when you access or use our Services. Through your use of the Services, you consent to the collection and use of this information as defined in the Privacy Policy.\n\n### 2. Your Account\nCertain features of the Services require a fluff4.me account (an "**Account**"). In order to create an Account, you must grant us permission through a process called "OAuth" to view basic identifying information for one of your accounts on a third-party service. You must then provide a display name, a confirmation of your age, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).\n\nYou are solely responsible for the information you associate with your Account, and anything that happens to affect the security of your Account. If you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission, you must immediately notify us by sending an email to [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me). You acknowledge that if we are unable to verify your identity in such a case, that we will be unable to assist.\n\nTo ensure the security of your Account, we recommend that you use multi-factor authentication for login, which could be either enabling TOTP (Time-based One Time Passcodes) or linking additional third-party login services, and requiring more than one of them for a successful login. You can view or edit these settings in your account\'s [Security Settings](/account/security).\n\nYou may create more than one Account on the Services, but only for purposes such as organisation, for example organising the content you follow, or the content you post. For more information about content, see section B.3 below.\n\n### 3. Your Content\nThe Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, or other materials ("**Content**"), including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account ("**Your Content**"). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.\nBy submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.\n\nBy submitting Your Content, you grant us license to store Your Content, transfer it, host it, parse it, make incidental copies or backups, and, if the Content is not considered "private", display it to other users. This license does *not* grant us the right to sell Your Content, distribute Your Content, or otherwise share the Content with third parties outside of the Services.\n\nExclusively for the purposes of moderation (i.e., automatically marking Content to require moderator review) or user experience (i.e., suggesting metadata such as tags), you grant us the right to use Your Content and any associated metadata as training examples for text-scanning tools or systems. Any collected training examples or created tools may not be used outside of the fluff4.me services, nor shared with third parties. In the case that these Terms of Service later change, collected training examples before the change may not be used for other purposes than the purposes listed at time of collection. \n\nYou retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Services, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted to us above, but not otherwise.\nYou grant other fluff4.me users a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Services. You may grant further rights to other users with the license you choose for Your Content. In any case not covered by the license you grant to us or to other fluff4.me users, Your Content shall be considered "All Rights Reserved".\n\nAny ideas, suggestions, and feedback about the Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that we may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.\n\n### 4. Your Restrictions\nWhen using or accessing the Services, you must comply with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n- Do not engage in any conduct that harasses, bullies, threatens, promotes violence or hatred, or otherwise discriminates against individuals or groups based on their race, colour, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender presentation, sexual orientation (or lack thereof), disability, age, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.\n- Do not reveal others\' personal or confidential information, nor threaten to do so.\n- Content including suggestive, predatory, or otherwise inappropriate behaviour involving minors is **strictly prohibited**. This is a zero-tolerance policy, and will result in an instant and permanent ban.\n- You agree to help protect other fluff4.me users by properly using the tag system for your works and chapters, especially in the case of graphic, sexually explicit, or offensive content.\n- Do not post illegal Content, or otherwise violate applicable law, including infringing on any person\'s or entity\'s intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.\n- Do not impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.\n- Authors retain the rights to their Content, and only grant fluff4.me the rights we require in order to process and display Content (see section B.3 "Your Content" above for more details). Content being available to view on fluff4.me does not inherently grant *you* the right to save a copy of the Content, and it *especially* does not grant you the right to *reupload* the Content to fluff4.me, or to other platforms or services. To know what rights an author has granted you for a particular work, look at the work\'s license.\n- You may not cheat or engage in any sort of content or engagement manipulation, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\t- Spamming, such as creating Content that exists for no other reason than to prevent other Content from being visible or "succeeding", or to annoy, frustrate, or otherwise inconvenience fluff4.me users; or\n\t- Providing false "engagement", such as favouriting/hearting or following an author, work, or chapter from more than one Account.\n- While we appreciate users helping us track down issues, do not intentionally use a known issue, exploit, or methodology to interfere with, disable, disrupt, overburden, or otherwise impair the Services.\n- If your Account has been banned or locked, you may not continue to use our Services on another Account, whether or not that Account was created before you were banned. If you believe you were falsely banned, send an email to [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me).\n- Do not gain or attempt to gain access to another user\'s Account or their private Content.\n- Do not upload, transmit, or distribute to or through the Services any viruses, worms, malicious code, or other software intended to interfere with the Services, including its security related features. Do not knowingly create links on the Services that would send a user to an external location with viruses, worms, or otherwise malicious code. If you are made aware that a link you created on the Services has begun to point to a location with viruses, worms, or otherwise malicious code, you must remove the link at the earliest possibility.\n\n### 5. Rule Enforcement\nThese Terms, rules, and restrictions are enforced through moderator action, including, but not limited to:\n1. Giving you warnings through the fluff4.me notification system;\n2. Stripping parts of ("**censoring**"), making private ("**locking**"), or removing Your Content;\n3. Removing privileges from your Account, including both privileges granted from the start, and privileges granted over time;\n4. Temporarily or permanently locking your Account; or\n5. Terminating and deleting your Account (being "**banned**").\n\nWe may, in our sole discretion, at any time and without warning, use any or all methods of enforcement against you, for any violation of these Terms, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us. \n\nIf your Account has been banned or locked, you may not continue to use our Services on another Account, whether or not that Account was created before the moderation action. If you believe the moderation action was incorrect, send an email to [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me).\n\n## C. DMCA\nfluff4.me respects the intellectual property rights of others. Per the DMCA, we will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement on the Services if submitted to our Copyright Agent as described below. Upon receipt of a notice alleging copyright infringement, we will take whatever action we deem appropriate within our sole discretion, including removal of the allegedly infringing Content and termination of access for repeat infringers of copyright-protected content.\nIf you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated by us or by a third party who has uploaded Content to our Services, please provide the following information to the designated Copyright Agent listed below:\n- A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;\n- A description of where the Content that you claim is infringing is located on the Services;\n- An address, telephone number, and email address where we can contact you and, if different, an email address where the alleged infringing party, if not we, can contact you;\n- A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorised by the copyright owner or other intellectual property rights owner, by its agent, or by law;\n- A statement by you under penalty of perjury that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or are authorised to act on the owner\'s behalf;\n- Your electronic or physical signature.\nfluff4.me may request additional information before removing any allegedly infringing Content. In the event we remove the allegedly infringing Content, we will immediately notify the person responsible for posting such Content that we removed or disabled access to the Content. We may also provide the responsible person with your email address so that the person may respond to your allegations.\nPursuant to 17 U.S.C. 512(c). fluff4.me designated Copyright Agent is:\nJonathan Bailey\nCopyByte\n3157 Gentilly Blvd Suite # 2254\nNew Orleans, LA 70122\nPhone: 1-504-356-4555\nEmail: fluff4me-dmca@copybyte.com\n\n## D. Indemnity\nExcept to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold fluff4.me, its affiliates, and their respective, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, third-party service providers, and licensors (the "**fluff4.me Entities**") harmless from and against any claim or demand made by any third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense (including costs and attorneysâ€™ fees) due to, arising out of, or in connection with: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations; or (d) Your Content. We reserve the right to control the defense of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.\n\n## E. Disclaimers\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, LEGAL, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\nTHE FLUFF4.ME ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR FREE. THE FLUFF4.ME ENTITIES DO NOT MAKE WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES, WHETHER SUBMITTED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WHETHER THE CONTENT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE ON THE SERVICES. FLUFF DOES NOT CONTROL, ENDORSE, OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR LINKED TO THE SERVICES OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR USER, INCLUDING MODERATORS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES SAFE, WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT OUR SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CODE.\n\nEXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE FLUFF4.ME ENTITIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXAMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES THAT IS ALLEGED TO BE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL. ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR RESULTING LOSS OF DATA. THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE FLUFF4.ME ENTITIES WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100) OR ANY AMOUNT YOU PAID FLUFF IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n\n## F. Termination\nYou may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Account and discontinuing use of all Services. It is your responsibility to perform this action; your Account being inactive will not cause it to be automatically deleted.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may suspend or terminate your Account, or ability to access or use the Services at any time for any or no reason, including for violating these Terms.\n\nAll provisions of these Terms which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination â€” including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.\n\n## G. About these Terms\n\n### 1. Section Headings\nThroughout the Terms, titles are used in section headings for reference and readability. These titles are not legally binding and will not be considered in the interpretation of these Terms.\n\n### 2. Changes to the Terms\t\nWe may modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we\'ll let you know in these ways:\n1. The date at the top of the policy will change.\n2. The next time you visit fluff4.me after a Terms of Service update, it will prompt you to reaffirm that you have read and agree with the revised Terms.\n\nSince we do not collect email addresses, we do not have a way to contact you about Terms of Service changes outside of when you\'re using the application. When we update these Terms, we\'ll try to give you a bit of notice before they come into effect. \n\nBy continuing to use the Services after changes to the Terms of Service go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\n\n### 3. Disputes and Governing Law\nYou agree to raise issues or disputes with us and work with us to resolve it informally. You can contact us with feedback and concerns by sending an email to [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me). \n\nThe laws of New Zealand will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in New Zealand, and you and fluff4.me agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.\n\n### 4. Miscellaneous\nIf any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Terms will be construed to reflect the partiesâ€™ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of fluff4.me to enforce any provision of the Terms will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under the Terms will survive any termination of the Terms.\n\nThese Terms are a legally-binding agreement between you and fluff4.me. If you have questions or concerns, please email us at [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me).'}]),"document/legal/privacy-policy/title":e=>i([{content:"Privacy Policy"}]),"document/legal/privacy-policy/v0":e=>i([{content:'*Last updated May 10th, 2025*\n\nThis document is mostly written in plain English to ensure you understand how and why fluff4.me ("**fluff**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") collects and uses information about you when you use our websites or APIs (collectively, the "**Services**").\n\n\n## What info is collected & used?\n### 1. Login Services\nAccount creation and login on fluff4.me is done exclusively through third party services, using a standard protocol called OAuth (Open Authorisation). When signing in with a third party service, that service provides basic information about you to us. fluff4.me stores and uses *very little* of the information given to it by third parties.\n\n#### Display Name\nWe store your third party service account\'s display name. This is used *only* in display to *you*, so that you can tell which third party service account you\'re using for login, in the case of third party services that allow people to have multiple accounts.\n\n#### Account Identifier\nIn order to be able to log you in on subsequent visits, we need to store a unique bit of information associated with your third party service account. The bit of information we use is a unique "identifier" for your account on the third party service. \n\nInstead of storing and using the identifier itself, we instead store and use a "hash" of it. "Hashing" in this case means taking some data, such as text, and performing a one-way operation on it that makes it nearly impossible to know the original data again.\n\nThis means that if, for whatever reason, someone got ahold of the data stored by fluff4.me, they wouldn\'t be able to easily see the connection between your fluff4.me account and your linked third party service account(s).\n\n### 2. Account Information\nAny information in your [Profile Settings](/account/profile), for example your display name, "vanity" name (i.e., username), and any description of yourself. Unless otherwise stated, this information is publicly accessible. You may modify or remove this information at any time, assuming fluff4.me is not undergoing maintenance.\n\n### 3. Preferences\nWhile using the fluff4.me website, some preferences (for example, preferences related to how content is displayed) are sent to our servers. This information is stored only to be later returned to you, for using the fluff4.me website (such as on another device). These preferences are specific to unique device resolutions, and as a result this data may identify what kind of device you\'re using, if you\'re using, for example, a phone with a very specific screen size.\n\n### 4. Your Content\nYou can provide both public and private content to fluff4.me. Private content is visible only to you, and only when you are signed in to the Services.\n\nPublic content can include your profile information, works (such as stories, blogs, articles, or poetry), chapters within works, and comments you leave on your own or others\' content. Content may contain text, links, and/or images.\n\nContent such as works and chapters that you have not explicitly set to "Public" are set to "Private" by default.\n\n### 5. Your Actions\nWe collect information about actions you take while using the Services, such as "favouriting" content (using the heart button), following content, ignoring content, and reporting content.\n\n### 6. Patreon\nPatreon is a third party service that we have provided an integration with. Authors may link their Patreon campaign so that they can use fluff4.me as a host of their patron-only content.\n#### Campaigns\nIf you\'re an author with a Patreon campaign, you can link your Patreon account in [Patreon Campaign Settings](/account/patreon), which, again, uses OAuth to give fluff4.me permission to request data about your Patreon account from the Patreon API. \n\nWe store information related to your campaign from Patreon, such as the display name, relevant URLs, and information about the tiers that patrons can pledge at.\n\nWe do not store the ability to request data about your Patreon account, and as a result you may need to re-link your Patreon campaign at a later date to use any updated information, such as new or modified tiers.\n\n#### Readers\nIf you\'re a reader who pledges to Patreon campaigns, you can link your Patreon account when prompted on a patron-only chapter, which, again, uses OAuth to give fluff4.me permission to request data about your Patreon account from the Patreon API.\n\nIn this case, we *do* store the ability to request data about your Patreon account (specifically, whether you\'re pledged to a campaign, and if so, at what tier), in order to reduce the number of times you have to authenticate with Patreon. This ability to request data about your Patreon account is "encrypted" before it\'s stored, meaning that in the case of a data breach, a malicious party would not have the ability to request your information from the Patreon API without first breaking the encryption, which is unlikely.\n\nWe do not request data related to your account from the Patreon API when not attempting to fulfil a request you make to our Services, and as such, our ability to request data may lapse after a period of time has passed. In this case, you will have to re-link your Patreon account when prompted on a patron-only chapter.\n\n### 7. Supporters\nIf you decide to "support" fluff4.me with a one-time purchase or a subscription, these transactions are processed through a third party service called Lemon Squeezy, which itself works through Stripe. These services are subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. \n\nAs these transactions are made and updated, we collect information about them, allowing you to use the fluff4.me website to keep track of your order and subscription history, and then manage it through Lemon Squeezy when needed. Information collected includes, but is not necessarily limited to: the "products" purchased (i.e., the specific supporter plan you selected, whether a one-time purchase or a subscription), the amount paid, the dates of purchases or renewals or expiries.\n### 8. Cookies\nfluff4.me is split into two applications, under two different web addresses: `https://fluff4.me`, and `https://api.fluff4.me`. When you visit the main fluff4.me website, your request is served by third party services including Cloudflare and GitHub Pages. We do not have a server here.\n\nWhile *using* the main fluff4.me website, or "app", requests are made to the fluff4.me API, `https://api.fluff4.me`. These requests *are* handled by our server.\n\nWhen making requests with the fluff4.me API, the API must first create a "session" with your device. This is done by creating a unique string of text called a "Session Token", and then sending this token back to your device as a "cookie". This cookie is then saved by your browser (under the name `Session-Token`), and subsequent requests to the fluff4.me API send that same cookie back so that the API can recognise who you are. This is considered a "necessary" cookie, as it\'s what allows you to stay logged in. The cookie persists for 5 days by default, but will be extended as you continue to use the API.\n\nfluff4.me â€” neither the main website, nor the API â€” uses cookies for any other reason. There is no tracking, and there is no advertising.\n### 8. Logging\nAs you access and use the fluff4.me API, a one-way hash of your IP will be used to perform rate limiting. It will not be stored.\n\nWhen you encounter errors while browsing (400 errors, which generally mean something going wrong on your end, and 500 errors, which means something going wrong on ours), these errors are collected and saved permanently, and are used to address any issues. These errors do not contain identifying information *except* in the case of when an error is shown while browsing your private content, in which case we *do* see the API endpoint that the error was thrown on. Usually, this simply identifies a particular work or chapter that the error occurred on.\n\n\n## Is information shared?\nNo, not unless required by law.\n\n\n## How is information protected?\nTraffic between you and the fluff4.me API is handled over HTTPS, which means it\'s "secured" â€” in other words, it\'s not plaintext, and can\'t be easily deciphered.\n\nfluff4.me very intentionally does not allow signup with an email address and password, as most platforms do, as our development team is small. We do our best to protect what sensitive information we do store, but focusing on limiting the amount of sensitive data is in our opinion the best way to prevent the typical bad consequences of a data breach.\n\nIn order to protect your account outside of a data breach, login is handled through third party services via OAuth, as described in the "Login Services" section above. In your [Security Settings](/account/security), you can configure how many of your linked login service accounts are required to be re-linked in order to login. Because login in this case would require multiple separate "factors" that *all* must have been taken over by a malicious actor, this is considered a form of "multi-factor authentication". The more "factors" you require, the safer your account will be. Consider also enabling TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passcodes) for your account, which counts as an extra factor without requiring you to link another third party service.\n\n\n## How can info be managed?\n\n### Requesting Data\nIf you\'d like to request a copy of the data collected for your account, please send an email to [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me). We don\'t currently have the capability to compile this data, but by law we have 30 days to comply with the request, and we\'ll use that time to implement that capability and, when finished, reply to your email with instructions on how to proceed.\n\n### Deleting Data\nWorks, chapters, and comments can all be deleted while viewing the content in question.\n\nDeleting your account can be done in [Account Settings](/account/more). Note that in the case of comments you\'ve left with your account, this *will* retain an empty space where your comment used to be in order to preserve other users\' replies. However, it won\'t be possible for users to tell that you were the author of the removed comment.\n\nIf you are unable to delete your account (this is a common place for errors to occur due to technical reasons), please send an email to [support@fluff4.me](mailto:support@fluff4.me).
