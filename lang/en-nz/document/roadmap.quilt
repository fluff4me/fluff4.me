	## Up Next
	
	<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">
	#### Feature more than just new works
	*Replace the "New" view with a "Home" that also shows what's trending or "hot", what's recently completed, and more!*
	</WEAVE>
	
	<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">
	#### Customisable home
	*In the "Home" view, allow setting up multiple custom filters, so you can see what's new, hot, or recently completed in each of them!*
	</WEAVE>

	<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">
	#### Recommendations
	*Recommend works to forward the love from your followers! You'll be able to attach a message about why you're recommending the work, and the recommendation will be visible on your profile.*
	</WEAVE>

	---
	## Soon
	
	<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">
	#### Chapter scheduling
	*Set a schedule for your work as a whole, resulting in newly uploaded chapters releasing to patrons or publicly on particular days.*
	</WEAVE>
	
	<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">
	#### Work promotion
	*Being a supporter will grant you a certain number of monthly "promotions" to use on your works as you see fit. These promotions will place your work in the recommendations sidebar of fluff4.me readers.*
	{#SUPPORTERS-ONLY:}
	</WEAVE>
	
	---
	## Later
	
	<WEAVE TAG=".MINIBLOCK">
	#### Collections
	*Imagine a music or video playlist, but instead for works. Useful for:*
	- *An ongoing series of books (works) â€” in which case you'll also be able to set it so that following one work is equivalent to following the series itself.*
	- *Groups of works by various authors around a theme, like an anthology, or related to an event of some kind.*
	- *Making a collection of stories you'd like to recommend reading.*
	- *Making a collection of stories to hold stories by other authors set in one of your universes, or to hold fanfics for one of your stories.*
	
	</WEAVE>

	#### And much more!
	*We can't spoil all the surprises on the distant horizon, now can we?*  
	*<sub>(We could tbh, it would just take ten million years to write it all out and we'd rather work on the site.)</sub>*
